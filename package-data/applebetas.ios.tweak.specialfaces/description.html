<p>Enable the special watch faces on any Apple Watch.</p>
<p>In watchOS, there are three sets of watchfaces that are included but only shown if you have a certain watch model. These are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nike+ Digital</li>
    <li>Nike+ Analog</li>
    <li>Herm&egrave;s faces</li>
</ul>
<p>With this tweak installed, they will show up in the watch app and be able to be added from the Gallery tab.</p>
